### Progress so far -

- ~~Styling completed~~

- **9th Aug 2023 @ 12 Noon** : Figuring out the logic for the app
- **9th Aug 2023 @ 3:58 PM** : Figured basic operations on whole numbers. However, encountered the following bugs -
  - ~~After pressing equal, it shows the results just fine.~~
  - ~~From this moment onwards, if pressed a number, it should do a fresh calculation.~~
  - ~~If pressed an operator, should continue the operation.~~
  - _In my current program, after a number is pressed, the digits concatanate with the current result on screen._
  - **9th Aug 2023 @ 7PM** : Solved the bug equal button bug
- **10th Aug 2023 @ 1:33PM** : The current issues in hand -
  - Make users use the decimal point only once
